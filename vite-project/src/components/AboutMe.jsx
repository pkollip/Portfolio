            I am a software engineer with a passion for building things. I am
            currently working as a software engineer at a startup in the bay area.
            I have experience in building full stack web applications and I have a
            passion for machine learning. I am always looking to learn new things 
            and I am always looking to work on interesting projects. 
            I am also interested in the intersection of technology and policy and how
            technology can be used to solve real world problems.
